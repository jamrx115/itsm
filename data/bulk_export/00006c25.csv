Due that many of our corporate customers (Withholders) require the possibility to pay a different amount than the one included in the Barcode. we require your advise and assistance on making the Barcode available of customers with Strata 22 no to be forced to pay a fixed amount. I believe this is related to the Application Identifier (3900).

I'll appreciate your feedback as soon as possible for us to be able to implement this solution.

Thanks in advance!

The person that should help us now on is Jonathan Sosa (email: jsosa@achcolombia.com.co Tel:+57-1-7438300 ext: 1316). Pitifully, I wasn't able to get a hold of him but I sent him an email with some inquiries to start interacting with him. - As confirmed by Adriana, for ACH to provide the URL in production it's imperative to set up the IPSec connection and run the test drills just how it happened during the Test Environment setup. According to Hector, the PROD IP's and Pre shared Key from ACH have already been configured in their FW but are still waiting to be notified on who will be the ACH tech contact in charge of running the tests and ETA for the drills to be executed. // I expect to have a call with Jonathan Sosa today to clarify this Item. - Today I will gather with Neeti to clarify what actions has been taken from SDG's side on regards to the WS that eDocs needs to consume to report payments, also the testing and results obtained. on the other hand, I'll try to gather as much inquiries as possible to discuss them with Jonathan Sosa. Just For Clarification: - The Web Portal where the customer will login and perform the PSE Payment actions is provided and hosted by PSE - ACH and has a static URL (No Post or Get). - The 2 WS that PSE needs to consume for payments were built by eDocs based on Specs Docs provided by ACH. These WS can't reached out of the IPSec Connection. OK - eDocs will only return to PSE the Invoices associated to the provided CustomerID that have an expiration date no older than the date of consultation. - eDocs SIT, PQT and UAT environments should be consumed by the same ACH Test host. // to be confirmed with Hector and Adriana on how this would work. - The Payment button to be included in the emails body is a HughesNet Logo which is already available in ACH's test portal.
